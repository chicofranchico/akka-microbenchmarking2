Akka Microbenchmark 2

The purpose for this benchmark is to compare local execution vs. remote execution of actors using the random ping with hops algorithm.

The algorithm sends 'ping' messages to all the workers (akka-actors). These then randomly choose a worker to send another 'ping' message to. At each worker, the message hop is decreased until it reaches zero, converging the algorithm to terminate.

8 workers are used in total for both cases. In the remote case we use 2 machines where 4 workers are instantiated in each.

The machines are iMacs with Core i7's 3Ghz with 4GB of RAM each.
The network was an exclusive one (with only the two machines) @ 100Mbit.

These are the results:

Parameters
Number of actors / workers: 8
Number of initial messages: 10000
Number of hops: 100
Repetitions: 5

Difference:

154680.8364 / 1515.8066 â‰ˆ 102.05

These results show a performance degradation of 100x by simply using remote actors.
